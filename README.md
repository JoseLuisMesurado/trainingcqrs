- Please run docker-compose.yml. This will create the database and everything needed to run the projects. However I use debian, maybe it is necessary to change the dockerfile path ("remove ./") in windows. 
- I have added a har and json files to export the endpoints to postman or insommia as well. Api url is "base_url": "http://localhost:8081",
